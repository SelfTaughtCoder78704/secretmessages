# secretmessages
<p>A simple javascript app that allows you to write messages that get scrambled into non-sense, then allows your receiver to use the app to decode back to its original state.</p>
<p>I used this app to help me learn Vanilla Js. It could probably be coded way better, but I enjoyed building it.</p>
